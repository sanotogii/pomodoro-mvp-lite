# Pomodoro Timer (Python Version)
A fully functional Python-based Pomodoro Timer I'm using while taking my time to learn Next.js properly. This app implements a progressive Pomodoro approach - rather than strict 25-minute sessions, it adapts to your flow state and work rhythm.

## Project Context ðŸŽ¯
This is my working Pomodoro timer that I'll be using while learning Next.js at my own pace. Rather than rushing to build a web version without proper knowledge, I've created this Python app to:
- Have a functional timer that adapts to my workflow
- Track my focus sessions and progress
- Serve my needs while I take time to properly learn Next.js
